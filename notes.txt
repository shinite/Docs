vagrant halt in git bash to shut down the machine
exit to come out of vagrant
vagrant ssh to enter vagrant
vagrant up will only happen inside d:/workspace, it is to put on the virtual machine.
ssh-> secure shell to get inside secure shell of the virtual machine
since all our files are inside vagrant we need to go to cd /vagrant.
go inside exercise1 and den run the http-server. so that the required file can be executed.
In order to connect outside we have two adaptors in the vm. and there is a internal local host 127.0.0.1
to run in either one of the port we use
wen we run http-server it listens to two adaptors: the external adap. and the internal adapt.
vagrant has done the virtural networking for us.
http-server -a 127.0.0.1(the ip of local ) we wont b able to access in the browser while for 10.0.2.15 it will b working
now instead of using localhost we can use our devices' ip

so  the 10.0.2.15 (external adaptor)is connected to the outside ports but the internal adaptr is not connected.

vagrant helps to create a disposable evs.
